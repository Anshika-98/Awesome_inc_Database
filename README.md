# Awesome_inc_Database

The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in various aspects of database management involving different database systems, data warehousing, data analytics and business intelligence techniques. We worked with two different database systems, an OLTP database for online transactions and a DW database for data warehousing and analytics. This project helped us understand the process of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) and CDC (Change Data Capture) for data movement between the databases. We also worked with data visualization tools such as Tableau for data analytics.

The OLTP database stores the sales and returns data and the DW database can be used to analyze the data for decision-making purposes. The system also includes an ETL process for loading data from the OLTP database to the DW database, transforming the data to match the DW schema design, and implementing incremental ETL using the CDC approach. The project also utilizes advanced database features such as external tables, partitioned tables, function-based indexes, PL/SQL procedures, functions, packages, and triggers
